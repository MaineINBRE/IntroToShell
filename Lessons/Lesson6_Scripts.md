We are finally ready to see what makes the shell such a powerful programming environment.
We are going to take the commands we repeat frequently and save them in files
so that we can re-run all those operations again later by typing a single command.
For historical reasons,
a bunch of commands saved in a file is usually called a **shell script**,
but make no mistake:
these are actually small programs.

Let's start by going to an example directory called `molecules/` and putting the following line into a new file, `middle.sh`:

~~~
$ cd molecules
$ nano middle.sh
~~~
{: .bash}

The command `nano middle.sh` opens the file `middle.sh` within the text editor "nano"
(which runs within the shell).
If the file does not exist, it will be created.
We can use the text editor to directly edit the file---we'll simply insert the following line:

~~~
head -n 15 octane.pdb | tail -n 5
~~~
{: .source}

This is a variation on the pipe we constructed earlier:
it selects lines 11-15 of the file `octane.pdb`.
Remember, we are *not* running it as a command just yet:
we are putting the commands in a file.

Then we save the file (`Ctrl-O` in nano),
 and exit the text editor (`Ctrl-X` in nano).
Check that the directory `molecules` now contains a file called `middle.sh`.

Once we have saved the file,
we can ask the shell to execute the commands it contains.
Our shell is called `bash`, so we run the following command:

~~~
$ bash middle.sh
~~~

~~~
ATOM      9  H           1      -4.502   0.681   0.785  1.00  0.00
ATOM     10  H           1      -5.254  -0.243  -0.537  1.00  0.00
ATOM     11  H           1      -4.357   1.252  -0.895  1.00  0.00
ATOM     12  H           1      -3.009  -0.741  -1.467  1.00  0.00
ATOM     13  H           1      -3.172  -1.337   0.206  1.00  0.00
~~~

Sure enough,
our script's output is exactly what we would get if we ran that pipeline directly.

## Text vs. Whatever

We usually call programs like Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer "text
editors", but we need to be a bit more careful when it comes to
programming. By default, Microsoft Word uses `.docx` files to store not
only text, but also formatting information about fonts, headings, and so
on. This extra information isn't stored as characters, and doesn't mean
anything to tools like `head`: they expect input files to contain
nothing but the letters, digits, and punctuation on a standard computer
keyboard. When editing programs, therefore, you must either use a plain
text editor, or be careful to save files as plain text.

What if we want to select lines from an arbitrary file?
We could edit `middle.sh` each time to change the filename,
but that would probably take longer than just retyping the command.
Instead, let's edit `middle.sh` and make it more versatile:

~~~
$ nano middle.sh
~~~

Now, within "nano", replace the text `octane.pdb` with the special variable called `$1`:

~~~
head -n 15 "$1" | tail -n 5
~~~

Inside a shell script,
`$1` means "the first filename (or other parameter) on the command line".
We can now run our script like this:

~~~
$ bash middle.sh octane.pdb
~~~

~~~
ATOM      9  H           1      -4.502   0.681   0.785  1.00  0.00
ATOM     10  H           1      -5.254  -0.243  -0.537  1.00  0.00
ATOM     11  H           1      -4.357   1.252  -0.895  1.00  0.00
ATOM     12  H           1      -3.009  -0.741  -1.467  1.00  0.00
ATOM     13  H           1      -3.172  -1.337   0.206  1.00  0.00
~~~

or on a different file like this:

~~~
$ bash middle.sh pentane.pdb
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
ATOM      9  H           1       1.324   0.350  -1.332  1.00  0.00
ATOM     10  H           1       1.271   1.378   0.122  1.00  0.00
ATOM     11  H           1      -0.074  -0.384   1.288  1.00  0.00
ATOM     12  H           1      -0.048  -1.362  -0.205  1.00  0.00
ATOM     13  H           1      -1.183   0.500  -1.412  1.00  0.00
~~~

We still need to edit `middle.sh` each time we want to adjust the range of lines,
though.
Let's fix that by using the special variables `$2` and `$3` for the
number of lines to be passed to `head` and `tail` respectively:

~~~
$ nano middle.sh
~~~

~~~
head -n "$2" "$1" | tail -n "$3"
~~~

We can now run:

~~~
$ bash middle.sh pentane.pdb 15 5
~~~

~~~
ATOM      9  H           1       1.324   0.350  -1.332  1.00  0.00
ATOM     10  H           1       1.271   1.378   0.122  1.00  0.00
ATOM     11  H           1      -0.074  -0.384   1.288  1.00  0.00
ATOM     12  H           1      -0.048  -1.362  -0.205  1.00  0.00
ATOM     13  H           1      -1.183   0.500  -1.412  1.00  0.00
~~~

By changing the arguments to our command we can change our script's
behaviour:

~~~
$ bash middle.sh pentane.pdb 20 5
~~~

~~~
ATOM     14  H           1      -1.259   1.420   0.112  1.00  0.00
ATOM     15  H           1      -2.608  -0.407   1.130  1.00  0.00
ATOM     16  H           1      -2.540  -1.303  -0.404  1.00  0.00
ATOM     17  H           1      -3.393   0.254  -0.321  1.00  0.00
TER      18              1
~~~

This works,
but it may take the next person who reads `middle.sh` a moment to figure out what it does.
We can improve our script by adding some **comments** at the top:

~~~
$ nano middle.sh
~~~

~~~
# Select lines from the middle of a file.
# Usage: bash middle.sh filename end_line num_lines
head -n "$2" "$1" | tail -n "$3"
~~~

A comment starts with a `#` character and runs to the end of the line.
The computer ignores comments,
but they're invaluable for helping people (including your future self) understand and use scripts.
The only caveat is that each time you modify the script,
you should check that the comment is still accurate:
an explanation that sends the reader in the wrong direction is worse than none at all.

What if we want to process many files in a single pipeline?
For example, if we want to sort our `.pdb` files by length, we would type:

~~~
$ wc -l *.pdb | sort -n
~~~

because `wc -l` lists the number of lines in the files
(recall that `wc` stands for 'word count', adding the `-l` flag means 'count lines' instead)
and `sort -n` sorts things numerically.
We could put this in a file,
but then it would only ever sort a list of `.pdb` files in the current directory.
If we want to be able to get a sorted list of other kinds of files,
we need a way to get all those names into the script.
We can't use `$1`, `$2`, and so on
because we don't know how many files there are.
Instead, we use the special variable `$@`,
which means,
"All of the command-line parameters to the shell script."
We also should put `$@` inside double-quotes
to handle the case of parameters containing spaces
(`"$@"` is equivalent to `"$1"` `"$2"` ...)
Here's an example:

~~~
$ nano sorted.sh
~~~

~~~
# Sort filenames by their length.
# Usage: bash sorted.sh one_or_more_filenames
wc -l "$@" | sort -n
~~~

~~~
$ bash sorted.sh *.pdb ../creatures/*.dat
~~~

~~~
9 methane.pdb
12 ethane.pdb
15 propane.pdb
20 cubane.pdb
21 pentane.pdb
30 octane.pdb
163 ../creatures/basilisk.dat
163 ../creatures/unicorn.dat
~~~

## Nelle's Pipeline: Creating a Script

An off-hand comment from her supervisor has made Nelle realize that
she should have provided a couple of extra parameters to `goostats` when she processed her files.
This might have been a disaster if she had done all the analysis by hand,
but thanks to `for` loops,
it will only take a couple of hours to re-do.

But experience has taught her that if something needs to be done twice,
it will probably need to be done a third or fourth time as well.
She runs the editor and writes the following:

~~~
# Calculate reduced stats for data files at J = 100 c/bp.
for datafile in "$@"
do
    echo $datafile
    bash goostats -J 100 -r $datafile stats-$datafile
done
~~~

(The parameters `-J 100` and `-r` are the ones her supervisor said she should have used.)
She saves this in a file called `do-stats.sh`
so that she can now re-do the first stage of her analysis by typing:

~~~
$ bash do-stats.sh *[AB].txt
~~~

She can also do this:

~~~
$ bash do-stats.sh *[AB].txt | wc -l
~~~

so that the output is just the number of files processed
rather than the names of the files that were processed.

One thing to note about Nelle's script is that
it lets the person running it decide what files to process.
She could have written it as:

~~~
# Calculate reduced stats for  A and Site B data files at J = 100 c/bp.
for datafile in *[AB].txt
do
    echo $datafile
    bash goostats -J 100 -r $datafile stats-$datafile
done
~~~

The advantage is that this always selects the right files:
she doesn't have to remember to exclude the 'Z' files.
The disadvantage is that it *always* selects just those files --- she can't run it on all files
(including the 'Z' files),
or on the 'G' or 'H' files her colleagues in Antarctica are producing,
without editing the script.
If she wanted to be more adventurous,
she could modify her script to check for command-line parameters,
and use `*[AB].txt` if none were provided.
Of course, this introduces another tradeoff between flexibility and complexity.
